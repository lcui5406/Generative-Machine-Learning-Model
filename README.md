# X-ray Image Generation Model with GAN

## Overview
This project develops a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create high-quality synthetic X-ray images of hands. The GAN model leverages deep learning to synthesize images that mimic real medical X-rays, providing a valuable tool for medical research and training.

## Features
- **Generative Adversarial Networks**: Employs a GAN architecture to generate new images that replicate the statistical properties of the training dataset.
- **High-Quality Image Synthesis**: Ensures that the generated images maintain the clarity and resolution required for medical analysis.
- **Efficient Processing**: Designed to efficiently process and generate images, optimizing both time and resource usage.

## Data
Trained on a dataset of 8,000 real X-ray hand images, the model learns to produce new images that are indistinguishable from actual X-rays.

## Model Details
The project exclusively utilizes a GAN due to its ability to produce high-resolution and realistic images, surpassing other generative models in visual fidelity.

## Results
The GAN model generates 300 synthetic X-ray images available in the repository. These images are carefully reviewed to ensure their suitability for use in medical contexts.
